GM - I'm Ryan Park (@ryanology045), a washed peaked-early individual that's still working to shape the world for the better.

**Here's a quick history of my life**

VP of Intern Relations at Exponents (2024-Now era)
- I make stuff happen to: 
1) add a new dimension to the incentives games in crypto. 
2) prove to the world that liquidation-free markets can make markets efficient. 

Chief Human Calculator at Bear Market Labs (2023-Now era)
- Got back to building with the goal of making markets efficient. 
- Later formulated Exponents.

Mentally Unstable Blockchain Researcher with Alcohol in His Hands (2022-2023 era)
- Life in hard mode, but mentally and legally recovered now. 

Unofficial Forced Teacher of Blockchain Technologies at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor's Office (2022-2023 era)
- Self explanatory. 

Disgraced Fellow at Thiel Fellowship (2022-2023 era)
- A stain on the Fellowship's reputation until I build back better (yay Thiel Fellow tho). 

Cheap Slave Labour at Terraform Labs / Anchor (2020-2022 era)
- Had to do whatever was needed for Anchor to be a primary app for liquid-staked tokens with minimal pay. 
- Did not have control over the depeg nor the rates. 

Liquid Staking Guy at Everett Protocol (2019-2020 era)
- Was first to think of liquid staking alongside delegation vouchers (both were independently thought of!), presented to Vitalik, Lido, etc. 
- Influenced a bit on how liquid staking is now, (but sadly my contributions are largely forgotten), big advocate on why LSTs needed to be validator-fungible. 
- Realized the chicken and egg problem of LSTs needing integrations to be useful, later acquired by Terra (lol) to form the initial Anchor protocol team (lol again).
