# A Prion-Virus: we may not be prepared

**_Note: this writing is to flag a biosecurity concern of potentially high severity - many details and citations have intentionally been left out to not be a document of inspiration._**

We may be facing an emerging biosecurity threat that combines the lethality of prion diseases with the transmissibility of engineered viruses. The potential for this very specific construct has never been of discussion despite representing one of the most dangerous biorisk scenarios imaginable: a highly transmissible viral vector carrying genes that induce fatal prion diseases in infected hosts.

&nbsp;
## What are prions

Prions are infectious agents composed entirely of misfolded proteins. Unlike the usual pathogens such as bacteria or viruses, they contain no DNA or RNA, yet possess the ability to convert normal cellular proteins into their own lethal configuration. This process creates a cascade of neurodegeneration that is invariably fatal.

While prions are infectious and have the ability to reproduce by converting healthy proteins into copies of themselves, they are generally not considered "alive" under the classic textbook definition of life (whose definition itself is a target of rigorous debate as well).

One can consider prions to be a "corrupted" type of protein that 1) has been misfolded to a lower energy status than their "useful" counterparts, and 2) contains a unique ability to act as a catalyst to convert other normal proteins into a lower energy form, which has the same structure as itself.

Prions corrupt the host's own proteins, turning the host's own cellular machinery against itself. This process is slow, often undetectable for years-decades, and with present-day medical capabilities, impossible to stop once started.

Prions have 2 methods of initial expression within a host:

1) **Exposure from an external source**, from where the prions start replicating within the host.
2) **Carriers of genes that induce prion formation**, where hosts with certain genes are susceptible for a spontaneous prion formation, from where further replication starts.

The genes that induce prion formation have been actively studied (although some exact mechanisms still remain unknown). Such genes are well-characterized and a part of publicly available data.

&nbsp;
## The threat: viral delivery of prion-inducing genes

Recent exponential advances in gene editing and viral engineering are creating a new threat vector that combines the worst aspects of both biological hazards. Technologies to embed specific genes into a variety of viral vectors are becoming increasingly accessible, and combined with the fact that the genes behind prion formation are publicly available, this is a potential recipe for a massive disaster.

Unlike naturally occurring prions, where transmission is limited between hosts, **a viral vector carrying prion-inducing genes could theoretically spread through populations like any respiratory virus**. In such case, viral transmission and embeddings of prion genes could widely occur in the population for extended periods without detection. By the time the first prion symptoms start showing up, a vast amount of population may already be housing an incurable, 100% fatal condition - basically a death sentence that spreads.

While there still exist significant technological barriers today (which I will not name nor provide citations on), the near-future risk may be improper to ignore. The technological basics for such constructs already exist today and are becoming increasingly accessible: 

Genes that cause prion diseases are fully sequenced and publicly available in scientific databases.
Viral vector engineering is routine in research laboratories worldwide, even starting to move to certain biohacker fields.
Gene synthesis services can produce custom genetic sequences to order, sometimes even shipping samples in just days.
Unlike legitimate research facilities who conform to replication-deficient vectors, not all entities may make the same choices.

For now, we may remain a bit assured since the steps do present major research challenges (again, I insist not go into details on what the challenges are). However, this does not mean no action is needed. The theory is sound, and technologies are exponentially improving. **All while we remain completely unaware of this specific construct, which may have civilization-wide impact**.

&nbsp;
## The AI research acceleration factor

AI systems are already transforming biological research in directions that indirectly enable prion-virus development. With AI, protein design tools can computationally optimize prion-related gene sequences, while viral engineering platforms can predict optimal delivery vectors.

The procedural nature of genetic engineering makes it particularly relevant to AI assistance. Machine learning models can rapidly screen thousands of potential approaches, identify optimal backbone viruses, and suggest minimal genetic modifications needed to achieve desired properties. What required extensive laboratory iteration cycles before can now be computationally optimized before any physical experiments begin.

This would present a further shift in timelines and accessibility. AI democratizes expertise that previously required teams of specialists, compresses development timelines from years to months, and opens paths for smaller actors. The same AI capabilities driving legitimate gene therapy advances can be directly repurposed for harmful applications.

In contrast to speculative future threats, this acceleration is happening now. The convergence of accessible AI tools with the inherently systematic nature of prion-virus engineering may further shorten the timeline, outpacing existing biosecurity monitoring systems.

&nbsp;
## This could hurt civilization badly
The prion-virus represents a novel combination of dangerous characteristics that potentially make it one of humanity's concerns - perhaps even on par with other existential risks. When combined with AI advancements, the threat to humanity could further increase.

&nbsp;
### Delayed recognition until too late, and detection challenges
Those infected would be asymptomatic carriers during periods of viral activity, unknowingly spreading the virus (and the prion gene) throughout the population. In contrast to traditional biorisks that cause relatively immediate illness, this could theoretically allow massive, undetected distribution before anyone realizes such a spread had occurred.

While biosecurity monitoring has drastically improved post-COVID, their monitoring could be said to primarily focus on known pathogens. A virus carrying prion-inducing genes might appear harmless to standard screening, particularly if designed to mimic common, benign viruses.

&nbsp;
### Relatively straightforward procedures and their AI relevance
Traditional biorisks can very loosely be said to follow unreliable cycles of: poke holes until desired traits occur, enhance by repeating. This concept on the other hand is comparatively much more procedural and thus arguably much more controllable with less randomness.

The effectiveness of AI-accelerated research may even increase, considering procedural research plans are generally more predictable and optimizable using AI.

&nbsp;
### Environmental persistence & disinfection difficulty
Certain prions are known to persist in the environment for decades; environmental (soil, water, etc.) contamination of farmland and reservoirs could cause further impact to food and water distribution, while also carrying the potential to create long-lasting dead zones.

Prions are also notoriously resistant to destruction. They survive high temperatures, standard disinfectants, and even some sterilization procedures. Even standard medical procedures could become highly complex with a long list of bureaucratic checklists.

&nbsp;
### No medical countermeasures and their sociopsychological effects
Prion diseases currently have (and likely will not have anytime soon) no cure, no treatment, and no vaccine. The best efforts available today are to slightly delay the inevitable symptoms. Once symptoms appear, death is inevitable, typically within months. Even if the spread were identified immediately, there would be no way to save those already infected with our current medical technologies.

The psychological aftermath of a society learning that everyone who caught a "flu-like illness" many years ago now carries the potential to die with 100% certainty would be immense. Long-term planning, economic systems, and social structures could collapse under the influence of mass fatalism, panic, and nihilism. Xenophobia and extremist ideologies could also spread like wildfire.

&nbsp;
## We are probably not well-prepared enough
Despite the potential severity of this threat, humanity's defensive posture can be said to be quite ill-positioned across multiple dimensions.

&nbsp;
### Lack of risk awareness & regulatory / AI safety blindspots
Existing biological weapons treaties and international oversight mechanisms were designed for previous generations of threats and can be said to be mostly still stuck on the same mental model - novel emerging biorisks are just starting to get coverage, but only recently.

While prion research has recently been identified as dual-use research of concern, a prion-virus construct still remains completely unknown and regulations remain far too weak relative to the potential civilizational risk. Most oversight focuses on traditional biological weapons, not this novel threat vector. Institutional biosafety committees and export controls do provide some oversight, but again, these frameworks generally assume traditional pathogen behavior and not deeply consider this specific novel construct.

There are even commercial AI models out there today (at the time of writing) that don't even flag prompts related to this concept and have delivered detailed step by step execution plans together with fatality estimates (I will not drop names on which companies or models, nor provide details on such for obvious reasons - I sincerely hope immediate and thorough patching is applied), likely due to its conceptual novelty. All while the proliferation of locally-run models makes comprehensive content filtering practically impossible.

&nbsp;
### Research accessibility
The democratization of biotechnology means that gene synthesis, viral engineering, and AI-assisted research design are increasingly becoming available to everyone, whoever that might be. While commercial gene synthesis companies implement screening protocols for dangerous sequences and laboratory security standards exist, coverage varies significantly (by nation, region, and company) and such systems weren't designed for specific novel threat combinations. And exact prion gene sequences are available on public scientific databases.

&nbsp;
## The window may be closing
The convergence of accessible gene editing, improved viral engineering, and AI-assisted research is rapidly lowering the barriers to developing prion-viruses. Meanwhile, our defensive capabilities could be said to lag far behind. We might be facing a narrow window to implement better safeguards before this threat becomes readily achievable by a much broader range of actors.

The scientific community continues developing legitimate applications of viral vectors for gene therapy, often targeting the same biological pathways that could be weaponized. This dual-use research creates additional vectors for knowledge transfer and technique refinement that could be exploited by malicious actors.

Even if we were to determine such attempts to be too complicated to achieve today, biotech and AI advancements mean the feasibility is approaching reality at an exponential speed. The timeframes may be measured in years, not decades.

&nbsp;
## A call for awareness
The prion-virus threat, amplified by AI development, may deserve urgent, comprehensive action across multiple fronts.

Heightened oversight on research involving a combination of viral vectors and prion-related genes is deemed necessary, including both for government and private research facilities. Bioweapons oversight frameworks and routine biological surveillance, both regional and international, would need to consider prion-virus constructs.

AI systems would need to more thoroughly flag prion-related prompts and perform deep evaluation on specific examples of dual-use biorisks (not just a vague acknowledgement on the overall risks), including but not limited to this prion-virus construct.

Both the AI safety and biosecurity communities would need to recognize that the intersection of these threats compresses all timelines. The prion-virus represents a class of threat that - at the very extreme - could even end human civilization as we know it. Unlike climate change or even nuclear war, it could even offer no opportunity for recovery or gradual adaptation. In such case, once deployed successfully, it would create an irreversible cascade of societal collapse.

The time for action could be now, while we still retain the capability to prevent this hypothetical threat from becoming reality. The convergence of biotechnology advancement and AI development means we may have limited time to address what could potentially be an ultimate threat to human civilization.
