**Quick story**

Exponents (2024-Now)
1) add a new dimension to the incentives games in crypto. 
2) prove to the world that liquidation-free markets can make markets efficient. 

Life in hard mode (2022-2023)

Terraform Labs / Anchor (2020-2022)
- Had to do whatever was needed for Anchor to be a primary app for liquid-staked tokens with minimal pay. 
- Did not have control over the depeg nor the rates. 

Everett Protocol (2019-2020)
- Was first to think of liquid staking alongside delegation vouchers (both were independently thought of), presented to Vitalik, Lido, etc. 
- Influenced a bit on how liquid staking is now, (sadly my contributions are largely forgotten), big advocate on why LSTs needed to be validator-fungible. 
- Realized the chicken and egg problem of LSTs needing integrations to be useful, later acquired by Terra to form the Anchor team. 

**Presence**
- TBD
